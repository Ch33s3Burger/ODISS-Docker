# Common User first steps

The common user can find Metabase under `www.example.com/metabase`. You have to replace
`www.example.com` with your `ODISS_SERVER_NAME` from the [environment properties](../env/dev.properties).
After running the [setup.sh script](./INSTALLATION.md) the correct URL to Metabase
is printed out.

If the admin has configured Metabase to use email as the invite method. The new
common user gets an email with an invitation link.
([Create a common user account](./GETTING_STARTED_ADMIN.md#create-a-common-user-account))

After logging into Metabase the common user can access all datasource's unlocked
for him by the admin.  For additional guidance, it is recommended
to use the [official Metabase tutorial](https://www.metabase.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started).
